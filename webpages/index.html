                    <dt>GUI</dt>
                    <dd>Abbr. for Graphic User Interface</dd>
                    <dd>When people use devices like laptops and smartphones, what they see on their screens are GUI. Every software has a GUI, and they are called interfaces because they are what users interact with. GUI uses the word graphic to denote that it is visually-oriented, rather than text-oriented or speech-oriented.</dd>
                    <dt>Terminal</dt>
                    <dd>The terminal is a software that allows a user to enter text-based commands for a computer to execute, or do. For instance, using a GUI, you would open a file by navigating to it through a file explorer or looking over your desktop and clicking through folders until finally, you open the file by double clicking on it. On the other hand, you can use a command in the terminal to open the file, <code class="inline">open ~/Desktop/filename.docx</code> or <code class="inline">open -a "Microsoft Word" ~/Desktop/filename.docx</code>.</dd>
                    <dd>On Mac and Linux machines, the terminal is referred to as terminal, whereas on Windows, you can use either Command Prompt (old) or Windows PowerShell.</dd>
                    <dt>Directory</dt>
                    <dd>Another word for folder. This is worth remembering as directory is used in some terminal commands.</dd>
                    <dd>Directory n. A listing or catalog of files and folders</dd>
                    <dt>Root Directory</dt>
                    <dd>A root directory is the topmost folder in a file system. It can be the folder of your project, the Desktop folder, or the C: drive. We call it the root because all relevant files and folders we're looking at or changing are contained in this main folder, and their filepaths will start with reference to it, such as C:/Windows/Users... and ~Desktop/my-project...</dd>
                    <dd><strong>Tilde ("til-duh") symbol</strong>: This is the ~ symbol and represents the root directory in a filepath.</dd>
                    <dt>Working Directory</dt>
                    <dd>The working directory is the directory you are currently working in.</dd>
                    <dt>Filepath</dt>
                    <dd>Like an address bar on a computer, a filepath denotes the chain of folders to go through to access a folder or file, such as: ~Users/GuestUser/My Videos/MontyPythonLondonWestEnd.mp4</dd>
                    <dt>Command Prompt</dt>
                    <dd>Each command in the terminal is called a command prompt, which is not a reference to the software on Windows. They are called command prompts for prompting, or eliciting, an action from a computer, whether that's creating and deleting files and folders, or listing the files in a directory.</dd>

                        <ul>
                            <li>cd: change directory</li>
                            <li>mkdir: make directory</li>
