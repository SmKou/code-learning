            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For learning to use the terminal, we are not going to use the command line found in some development softwares like VS Code, not yet at least. To follow along, all you need is to open either Terminal on Mac and Linux or PowerShell on Windows. If you have Git, and so Git Bash, installed, you can use Git Bash.</p>

            <p>Although you can use the file explorer for managing files and directories, it is much faster from the command line. Not to mention, it's easier to use a command to force some actions than going through directory settings, such as deleting a directory that has Git installed. Git is a version control system that tracks changes in the files and directories of a project. If you were using file explorer, Git would not let you delete a directory that's being tracked. Either you would force the deletion, or delete git.</p>

            <h3>Using the Terminal</h3>
            <p>For an introduction to the terminoloy, go to the software section in <a href="index.html#software">Terminology</a>. To come back to this page, either use the page nagivation, or menu, on the homepage, or click the link at the end of the software terminology section.</p>
            <p>In your terminal, navigate to your desktop. The command to change directories is 'cd'. You can use the tilde symbol to change the root.</p>
            <code>
                cd ~/Desktop
            </code>
            <p>Try switching to other directories you know are in your computer like the Users directory, or the Downloads directory.</p>
            <p>To see all the files and folders in your working directory, use the command: ls</p>
            <code>
                ls
            </code>
            <p>To open or navigate into one of the current directory's folders, you would cd into it with <code class="inline">cd directory_name</code> or <code class="inline">cd ...directories/directory_name</code></p>
            <p>The example <code class="inline">...directories/directory_name</code> denotes a filepath. When you use file explorer, you can click on the display showing what folders you've entered, right click and copy the filepath. A filepath is like an address of directories to reach a file or folder. For example, C:/Users/GuestUser/Downloads, the absolute filepath to your Downloads folder.</p>
